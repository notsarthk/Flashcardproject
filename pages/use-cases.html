            <p>Welcome to our interactive flashcard learning system! Using our flashcards is simple and effective. Start by selecting your preferred subject - Science, Mathematics, or Social Studies. Each subject offers three difficulty levels: Easy for beginners, Medium for intermediate learners, and Hard for those seeking a challenge. Once you've chosen your subject and difficulty, you'll be presented with a series of interactive flashcards. Click on a card to flip it and reveal the answer. Take your time to understand each concept, and use the cards as many times as you need. The system is designed to help you learn at your own pace, making it perfect for both quick reviews and in-depth study sessions. Whether you're preparing for an exam or just want to expand your knowledge, our flashcards provide an engaging and efficient way to learn.</p>
